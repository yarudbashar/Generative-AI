4. BACKGROUND 

The Metropolitan Council is the regional  agency of government for the Twin Cities 
metropolitan area. Centered on the cities of Minneapolis  and Saint Paul, the area is made up 
of the seven counties of Anoka, Carver, Dakota, Hennepin, Ramsey, Scott and Washington. 

The metro area is home to 3 million people in 7 counties and 186 cities and townships, 
encompassing nearly 3,000 square miles. 

Created by the Minnesota Legislature  in 1967, the Council fosters efficient and economic 
growth for a prosperous metropolitan region. The Council partners with local governments to 
coordinate the orderly development of the metro area, and provides innovative, efficient 
regional services that benefit from economies of scale. 

The Council's governing board has 17 members, appointed  by the governor. Sixteen 
members represent geographic districts of roughly equal population  across the region. The 
Council chair, the 17th member, serves at large. 

The Council's planning, investments, and services help provide the foundations for regional 
economic vitality. Guiding this work is the Council’s regional development guide, called 
Thrive MSP 2040. Thrive is a policy plan that state law requires the Council to prepare at 
least every 10 years as a framework for the metropolitan area’s “orderly and economical” 
development.  

Thrive identifies five regional outcomes to achieve:  

•  Stewardship – responsibly managing the region’s  natural and financial resources  

•  Prosperity – fostering investments in infrastructure and amenities that strengthen  the 

region’s economic competitiveness 

•  Equity – connecting all residents  to opportunity and creates viable housing, 

transportation,  and recreation options for people  of all races, ethnicities, incomes, and 
abilities 

•  Livability – creating the places and infrastructure that enhance the quality of life of the 

region’s residents 

•  Sustainability  – preserving the region’s capacity to maintain and support its well-being 

and productivity for generations  to come 

Thrive serves as a foundation for coordinated and consistent planning  between regional  and 
local governments. This coordination, in turn, helps achieve the regional  outcomes that 
Thrive affirms.  

Metropolitan Council

Contract No. 22P172

From Thrive’s overall policy direction, the Council develops plans for regional transportation, 
wastewater, and park systems that provide the framework for the comprehensive land use 
plans of local governments. 

The Council makes strategic investments in a growing network of bus and rail transitways, 
and awards grants to support transit-oriented  development to increase transportation 
choices, expand housing  and living options, and foster economic activity. The Council also 
plans and funds acquisition and development of a world-class system of regional parks and 
trails. 

Metro Transit, an operating division of the Council, carries more than 84 million bus and rail 
passengers  each year, and wins awards for innovation and energy efficiency. 

The Council collects and treats wastewater at rates 40% lower than those charged by peer 
regions, and regularly wins state and national  awards for environmental achievements.  

Through its Metropolitan Housing and Redevelopment Authority, the Council provides 
affordable housing  opportunities  for low- and moderate-income individuals  and families. 

The work of the Council is organized into four major units: 

•  Metro Transit – Bus, light rail, and commuter rail development and operations. 
•  Metropolitan Transportation  Services – Regional transportation  planning,  Metro Mobility 

services, dial-a-ride transit, and contracted transit services. 

•  Environmental Services – Wastewater treatment, water supply and water quality. 
•  Community Development - Regional parks and natural resources, research and regional 
policy, local planning assistance,  Livable Communities grant program, and Metropolitan 
Housing and Redevelopment Authority. 

This RFP is being issued for the Regional Administration Division of the Metropolitan 
Council. The Metropolitan Council is the contracting body.

C. Disclosure and Mitigation of Actual, Potential, and Perceived Conflicts of Interest  

Each Proposer must determine whether any actual, potential, or perceived conflicts of 
interest will exist if the Council awards a contract to the Proposer under this solicitation. 
Proposers are required to submit the Disclosure and Certification Regarding Conflict of 
Interest form included in this solicitation to certify, to the best of its knowledge and belief, 
that either: (1) the Proposer has determined that there are no relevant facts or 
circumstances which could give rise to conflicts of interest; or (2) the Proposer has 
determined that one or more conflicts of interest exists. If one or more conflicts of interest 
exist, the Proposer must provide a mitigation plan. Provisions will be included in the 
contract for this Project imposing continuing obligations  on the successful proposer to 
disclose to the Council all conflicts of interest which may be later discovered and 
consequences which may arise from such a situation;  and requiring the successful 
Proposer to cooperate with the Council in the elimination of any conflicts of interest.  

D. Mitigation or Neutralization  of Conflicts of Interest  

The Council, in its sole discretion, will determine whether a conflict of interest exists, 
whether a conflict of interest has been sufficiently mitigated, or whether a conflict of 
interest cannot be mitigated. For additional information, please see: the Council’s Conflict 
of Interest Guidelines,  available online at: https://metrocouncil.org/About-Us/What-We-

13. PROTESTS 

Proposers who wish to file a protest regarding the RFP process shall conform in all 
respects to the Council’s Protest Procedure. (See Attachment to the Proposal Instructions: 
Protests for Procurements $25,000 and Over.) All protests  must be addressed  to the RFP 
Administrator at the address  indicated in section 5. 

14. DATA PRACTICES ACT 

The Minnesota Government Data Practices Act provides that the names of proposers are 
public once the proposals are opened. With the exception of trade secret information as 
defined in Minnesota Statutes, section 13.37, all other information submitted by a Proposer 
in response  to this RFP becomes public at the times specified in the act and is then 
available to any person upon request. Trade secret information is defined in section 13.37 
as data, including a formula, pattern, compilation, program, device, method, technique, or 
process, (1) that was supplied  by the Proposer; (2) that is the subject of efforts by the 
Proposer that are reasonable  under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy; and (3) that 
derives independent  economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known 
to, and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by, other persons  who can obtain 
economic value from its disclosure or use. 

Any information in its response to this RFP for which the Proposer claims protection 
as trade secret information in accordance with the above provisions must be limited 
and set apart in the RFP response on separate pages, with a heading that identifies 
the information as trade secret information. The Council will make the ultimate 
determination whether the information meets the applicable definition. Any information 
submitted in response  to this RFP which does not meet the legal  definition will be 
considered public information, regardless  of the Proposer’s  identification of it as trade 
secret information. Proposers are advised that blanket-type identification by 
designating whole pages or sections as containing trade secret information will not 
assure protection --- the specific information for which the Proposer claims trade 
secret protection must be clearly identified as such. 

Submitted proposals shall not be copyrighted. A statement by the Proposer that 
submitted information is copyrighted or otherwise protected does not prevent public 
access to the information contained in the RFP response. 

15. FORM OF CONTRACT 

A copy of the standard Council contract for professional/technical  services is attached to 
this RFP as Attachment to the Proposal Instructions: Sample Professional/Technical 
Service Contract. The standard contract outlines  various legal  and administrative duties 
and responsibilities  assumed by persons or organizations  contracting with the Council. The 
successful Proposer will be expected to execute this contract.

16. INCORPORATION OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION REQUIREMENTS 

If a contract based upon this RFP or any modification of the contract exceeds a value of 
$100,000, the provisions of Minnesota Statutes, section 473.144, and Minnesota Rules, 
parts 5000.3400 to 5000.3600  will be incorporated into said contract or modification. The 
referenced provisions relate to contractor requirements for affirmative action plans for 
minority individuals,  women, and disabled  individuals.  Copies of the referenced provisions 
are available upon request from the RFP Administrator. Copies may also be accessed at 
the following internet web sites: 

•  Minnesota Statutes, section 473.144:  www.revisor.leg.state.mn.us/stats/473/144.html 

•  Minnesota Rules, parts 5000.3400  - .3600: www.revisor.leg.state.mn.us/arule/5000/ 

17. CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE FOR PUBLIC CONTRACTS 

The provisions of this section 17 apply only if the amount of the proposal exceeds 
$100,000. 

Under the provisions of Minnesota Statutes section 473.144, the Council may not accept a 
bid or proposal for over $100,000 from any business  having more than forty (40) full-time 
employees in Minnesota on a single working day during the previous twelve (12) months, 
unless that business  has submitted an affirmative action plan to the Minnesota 
Commissioner of Human Rights for approval. The Council may not execute a contract for 
over $100,000 with any business  having more than forty (40) full-time employees in 
Minnesota on a single  working day during the previous twelve (12) months, unless  that 
business  has an approved affirmative action plan, evidenced by a Certificate of Compliance 
from the Minnesota Department of Human Rights. A certificate is valid for 4 years. In 
addition,  for any business  which did not have more than forty (40) full-time employees in 
Minnesota, but which had more than forty (40) full-time employees on a single working day 
during the previous twelve (12) months in the state in which it has its primary place of 
business,  the Council may not execute a contract with such a business  unless  the business 
has an approved affirmative action plan, evidenced by a Certificate of Compliance from the 
Minnesota Department of Human Rights, or the business  certifies to the Council that the 
business  is in compliance with federal affirmative action requirements. 

To ensure compliance with this statute, Proposers must submit with their proposal EITHER: 

A. a copy of the Proposer’s currently effective affirmative action Certificate of Compliance 

issued by the Minnesota Department of Human Rights; OR 

B. an Affirmative Action Certification Statement (see Attachment to the Proposal 

Instructions: Affirmative Action Certification Statement) with information which indicates 
that the Council can accept the Proposer’s proposal. 

Failure to submit one of these documents along with the proposal may result in the 
proposal being rejected and returned to the Proposer without further consideration. 
Proposers are advised that the Council may verify representations made by a Proposer in 
any Affirmative Action Certification Statement which is submitted.

If a Proposer submits an Affirmative Action Plan for approval of the Minnesota 
Commissioner of Human Rights in order to qualify for acceptance of its proposal  by the 
Council and becomes the selected vendor, the Council will not execute the contract for 
services until the Proposer has actually been issued  a Certificate of Compliance from the 
Minnesota Department of Human Rights. The Council is under no obligation  to delay the 
award and execution of a contract until a Proposer has completed the human rights 
certification process. It is the sole responsibility  of a Proposer to apply for and obtain  a 
human rights certificate prior to contract award and execution. 

18. SUBCONTRACTING 

Proposers may subcontract for functions to fulfill the obligations  of their proposal.  All 
Proposers MUST complete and include the attached Subcontractor Information Form with 
their proposal, even if no subcontractors are proposed  to be used on this project. If the 
required Subcontractor Information Form is not submitted, the proposal may be found to be 
non-responsive and will not receive further consideration. 

Proposers must indicate on the form either: 

A. that no subcontractors will be used on this project; or 

B. the name, address,  and telephone  number of a) each subcontractor proposed to be 
used on the project AND b) each subcontractor who submitted a bid or quote for the 
project but was not selected by the Proposer. 

Proposers must also complete and execute the certification on page two of the form. (See 
Attachment to the Proposal Instructions: Subcontractor Information Form.)

$500,000, the provisions of Minnesota Statutes chapter 363A.44 will be incorporated into 
said contract or modification. The referenced provisions  relate to contractor requirements 
for equal pay certification. Copies of the referenced provisions are available upon request

employees in Minnesota or in the state where the business  has its primary place of 
business  on a single working day during the previous twelve (12) months from the due date 
of this solicitation,  unless that business  has an equal pay certificate or it has certified in 
writing that it is exempt. The Council may not execute a contract for over $500,000 with any 
business  having forty (40) or more full-time employees in Minnesota or in the state where 
the business  has its primary place of business  on a single working day during the previous 
twelve (12) months from the due date of this solicitation,  unless  that business  has an equal 
pay certificate, evidenced by a Certificate of Equal Pay. A certificate is valid for 4 years.  

To ensure compliance with this statute, Proposers must submit with their proposal EITHER: 

1.  a copy of the Proposer’s currently effective Equal Pay Certificate of Compliance issued 
by the Minnesota Department of Human Rights; OR 

2.  an Equal Pay Certification Statement (see Attachment to the Proposal Instructions: 
Equal Pay Certification Statement) with information which indicates that the Council can 
accept the Proposer’s proposal. 

Failure to submit one of these documents along with the proposal may result in the 
proposal being rejected and returned to the Proposer without further consideration. 
Proposers are advised that the Council may verify representations made by a Proposer in 
any Equal Pay Certification Statement which is submitted. 

If a Proposer submits an Equal Pay verification for approval of the Minnesota 
Commissioner of Human Rights in order to qualify for acceptance of its proposal  by the 
Council and becomes the selected vendor, the Council will not execute the contract for 
services until the Proposer has actually been issued  an Equal Pay Certificate from the 
Minnesota Department of Human Rights. The Council is under no obligation  to delay the 
award and execution of a contract until a Proposer has obtained an Equal Pay Certificate. It 
is the sole responsibility  of a Proposer to apply for and obtain an Equal Pay Certificate prior 
to contract award and execution.

1.  SCOPE OF WORK 

Contract Number: 22P170    Project Name: IT Professional Services and Staff Augmentation 

Project Overview  
The Metropolitan Council seeks service providers capable of offering IT staff augmentation 
resources and or IT professional  services. The Council intends to enter into Master Contracts 
with a cumulative award value anticipated to not exceed $35,000,000 over a five-year period. 
The Council reserves the right to award one-year Master Contracts with the option to extend for 
up to five years, in one-year periods.   

A Master Contract is multiple contracts used to make repetitive purchases of similar types of 
services on an as-needed basis.  Master Contracts will be signed by the Council and selected 
Proposer(s) to provide future, undefined work consistent with agreed terms and conditions as 
detailed in the contract.  

The Master Contracts shall not be construed as a guarantee of any number of work/projects or 
any total dollar amount of compensation. The assignment and number of work/projects will be 
made by specific Orders for Service to the selected Proposer(s) solely at the discretion of the 
Council.  

The Council anticipates  awarding a contract to multiple Proposer(s) for both IT staff 
augmentation and IT professional/managed services as part of this solicitation.  Selected 
Proposer(s) will be added to a list of approved vendors who will enter a master contract, and 
work assignment will be issued  via an Order for Service request. The work required will be 
either onsite or virtual and will be specified in the Order for Service. 

Overview of Order for Service Requests:  
The Council may request an Order for Service from the firms that match the scope of the 
particular assignment/project  or professional/managed service request. See Attachment No. 4 
for a Sample Order for Service.  The Order for Service request will include: 

1. Scheduled Start and End Date 

2. Submittal Information and Due Date 

3. Responsibilities 

4. Skills and Qualifications 

5. Required Experience 

6. Required Knowledge 

7. Desired Knowledge 

8. Work Environment/Location Type

10. Scope of Work 

The respective vendors will receive an Order for Service email for the specific assignment/ 
project. They will have 3 business  days from receiving the initial  Order for Service email request 
to respond.  

Responses to the Order for Service may be subject to negotiation  and shall not exceed the 
billing/hourly  rates provided in the initial price proposal response  and incorporated into the 
contract established  by the master contract. The Council may seek clarifying information about 
and or changes to proposals submitted. All respondents  will be notified of the results  by email 
within 3 business  days after a proposal is selected or a decision to not accept any proposal  is 
made.  

The Council reserves the right in accordance with Minnesota Statutes section 16C.16 to shelter 
Service Order Requests through our Metropolitan Council Underutilized Business  (MCUB) 
Select Program. This program is intended  to reduce barrios and increase utilization  of MCUB 
awarded Master Contracts. 

The staff augmentation resources are temporary or long-term contracted professionals provided 
by a third party and paid hourly. A list  of example positions  the Council may require are provided 
in Attachment No. 2. This list is not inclusive of all positions  that may be needed. When an 
Order for Service is sent for staff augmentation respondents  will need to furnish the resume of 
potential  candidates with their hourly rate and availability. The vendor may be requested to 
provide up to an hour of uncompensated time, if requested by the Council, to interview potential 
candidates prior to final selection.  

Service Categories:  
The professional  services for the purpose of this RFP are any consulting engagement for a fixed 
fee in exchange for defined deliverable(s) as opposed to an hourly engagement.  

Sample engagements the Council may request proposal  for, but are not limited to, include: 

•  Current state assessment and future state recommendations 

•  Design and installation  of network, security, infrastructure hardware 

•  Configuration of hardware and software 

•  Build out of monitoring and alerting environments

•  Design and build an application using Microsoft power apps or azure development tools 

•  Application architecture recommendation 

•  Replatform an oracle database  to SQL Server in Azure

Policy 

Purpose 

through 

The Metropolitan Council strives to ensure fairness to every offeror for all 
the  established  competitive 
goods  and  services  procured 
processes.  The  Council  acknowledges  its  responsibility  to  promptly  and 
fairly  investigate  procurement  protests  that  conform  to  the  requirements 
of  this  procedure.  The  Council  also  acknowledges  the  interest  of  the 
public  in  resolving  unjustified  claims  without  unduly  delaying  needed 
procurements.  To  balance  the  interests  of  offerors  and  the  public,  these 
procedures require that offerors file protests in a timely manner, carefully 
document  their allegations, and conform their protests to all requirements 
contained herein. 

Offerors  are  encouraged  to  resolve  questions  or  disputes  informally 
before  pursuing  a  written  protest.  If  offerors  believe  they  will  be  filing  a 
protest,  they  are  encouraged  to  advise  the  Council  verbally  as  soon  as 
possible  in order to maximize the offeror’s options. 

Written protests will be reviewed by designated staff, and a written protest 
decision  will  be  issued.  Protesters  may  request  a  single  reconsideration 
of the protest decision. The decision of the designated protest authority is 
final. The Council will not consider nor respond to oral protests. 

This  procedure  provides  a  process  for  a  full  and  fair  consideration of all 
claims  that  raise  legitimate  questions  about  the  procurement  process 
without  allowing  proposers  to  exploit  protest  procedures  to  obtain  a 
competitive  advantage  or  obstruct  needed  procurements.  The 
requirements  of  this  procedure  serve  important  public  purposes  and 
offerors  are  cautioned  that  noncompliance  will  result in waiver of protest 
rights.  Offerors  must  review  the  Council  procurement  protest  procedure 
carefully  before  filing  a  protest. At  the  time of filing a protest, the offeror 
agrees to be bound by this procedure. 

Applicability 

This  policy is applicable to all protests arising from Council procurements 
$25,000  and  over.  Note  that  violations of federal law or regulation will be 
handled by the complaint process as stated within that law or regulation. 

If  this  procurement  is  funded  in  whole  or  in  part  by  the  Federal  Transit 
Administration  (FTA),  offerors  are  hereby  notified  that  a  protester  must 
exhaust  all  administrative  remedies  with  the  Council  before  pursuing  a 
protest with FTA. Reviews of protests by FTA will be limited to:

XII.  ASSIGNMENT; SUBCONTRACTS 

12.01  Assignment. Except as provided in this part, the CONTRACTOR shall perform with its

subcontracts under state or local law. The CONTRACTOR shall not contract with any 
subcontractor to whom the COUNCIL has made objection. 

12.04  Requirements of Subcontractor Contracts. All subcontracts between the 
CONTRACTOR and its subcontractors shall require each subcontractor to be bound to the 
CONTRACTOR by the terms of this Contract, and to assume toward the CONTRACTOR all the 
obligations  and responsibilities  which the CONTRACTOR, by this Contract, assumes toward the 
COUNCIL. 

12.05  Subcontract Requirements. All subcontracts shall  expressly state that incorporation by 
reference of specific terms and conditions of this Contract shall not be deemed to create any 
contractual relationship  between the COUNCIL and any subcontractor, and that subcontractors 
are not third-party beneficiaries of this Contract. 

12.06  [RESERVED] 

12.07  Prompt Payment of Subcontractors. Consistent  with Minnesota Statutes, 
section 471.425, if any part of the Work is subcontracted, the CONTRACTOR shall pay any 
such subcontractor within ten (10) days of the CONTRACTOR's receipt of payment from the 
COUNCIL for undisputed services provided by the subcontractor. The CONTRACTOR shall not, 
by reason of said payments, be relieved from responsibility  for that portion of the Work done by 
the subcontractor and shall be responsible  for the entire Work until the same is finally accepted 
by the COUNCIL. 

The CONTRACTOR shall pay interest at the rate of one and one half percent (1½%) per month 
or part thereof to a subcontractor on any undisputed  amount not paid in accordance with the 
preceding paragraph. The minimum monthly interest payment for an unpaid balance of one 
hundred dollars ($100) or more is ten dollars ($10). For an unpaid balance of less than one 
hundred dollars ($100), the CONTRACTOR shall pay the actual interest due to the 
subcontractor. 

In accordance with Minnesota Statutes, section 471.425, a subcontractor who prevails in a civil 
action to collect interest penalties  from the CONTRACTOR must be awarded its costs and 
disbursements,  including attorney fees, incurred in bringing the action. Execution of this 
Contract constitutes the CONTRACTOR's consent to such award in the event a subcontractor 
prevails in such an action.

file and original  working papers, calculations, and notes developed as a result of the Work. The

laws of the State of Minnesota. Venue for all legal proceedings arising  out of this Contract, or 
breach thereof, shall be in the state or federal court with competent jurisdiction in Ramsey 
County, Minnesota. The CONTRACTOR shall comply with all applicable local, state or federal 
laws or regulations. The CONTRACTOR agrees that the most recent version of these shall 
govern at any given time. The CONTRACTOR shall exert its best efforts to give all notices 
required by law and to avoid violations of the law in connection with services provided under this 
Contract. The CONTRACTOR shall monitor its agents, subcontractors, and employees for the 
purposes of ensuring compliance with all applicable  laws. If any change in circumstances or law 
will affect the CONTRACTOR's performance under this Contract, the CONTRACTOR shall 
notify the COUNCIL’s Project Manager of the change in circumstances or law at the 
CONTRACTOR’s earliest opportunity. 

14.02  Independent Contractor Status. The CONTRACTOR, in performance of Work under 
this Contract, operates as an independent  contractor and covenants and agrees that it shall 
conduct itself consistent with such status, that it shall  neither hold itself out as nor claim to be an 
officer or employee of the COUNCIL by any reason of this Contract, and that it shall  not by 
reason of this Contract make any claim or demand nor apply for any right or privilege applicable 
to an officer or employee of the COUNCIL, including, but not limited to, workers’ compensation 
coverage, unemployment or reemployment insurance benefits, Social Security coverage, or 
retirement membership or credit. The CONTRACTOR assumes sole responsibility  for payment

Metropolitan Council

CONTRACTOR to perform services under this Contract shall not be considered an employee of 
the COUNCIL for any purpose. The CONTRACTOR shall be responsible for payment of all 
employee wages and benefits and the costs of any subcontractor. The CONTRACTOR shall 
comply with the requirements of employee liability, workers’ compensation, unemployment or 
reemployment insurance, and Social Security, as applicable to its operations. The CONTRACTOR 
shall have in effect personnel policies that conform to all applicable federal, state and local laws.

14.03  [RESERVED] 

14.04  Dispute Resolution. Claims by the CONTRACTOR disputing the meaning and intent of 
this Contract or arising from performance of this Contract shall be referred in writing to the 
COUNCIL’s Project Manager for a written decision. The COUNCIL’s Project Manager shall

calendar days from the receipt of the dispute or claim. Failure of the CONTRACTOR to appeal the

Official shall be a condition precedent to any litigation under this Contract. 

Pending final decision of a dispute under this article, the CONTRACTOR and the COUNCIL shall

temporarily resolved in accordance with the decision of the Dispute Official, until final resolution of 
the question or claim. Failure by the CONTRACTOR to comply precisely with the time deadlines 
under this paragraph as to any claim shall operate as a release of that claim and a presumption of 
prejudice to the COUNCIL.

data on individuals  is made available to the CONTRACTOR by the COUNCIL pursuant to this 
Contract, the CONTRACTOR shall administer and maintain any such data in accordance with 
Minnesota Statutes, Chapter 13 (the “Minnesota Government Data Practices Act”), and any 
other statutory provisions applicable to the data. If and to the extent that Minnesota Statutes,

collected, received, stored, used, maintained, or disseminated by the CONTRACTOR in 
performing this Contract are subject to the requirements of the Minnesota Government Data 
Practices Act; b) the CONTRACTOR must comply with those requirements as if it were a 
government entity; and c) the remedies in Minnesota Statutes, section 13.08 apply to the 
CONTRACTOR.

statement of the terms and conditions of the Contract between the CONTRACTOR and the 
COUNCIL. This Contract supersedes all prior representations,  understandings,  and 
communications. The validity in whole or in part of any term or condition of the Contract shall 
not affect the validity of other terms or conditions. The COUNCIL’s failure to insist  in any one (1) 
or more instances upon the CONTRACTOR's performance of any term or condition of the 
Contract shall not be construed as a waiver or relinquishment of the COUNCIL’s right to such 
performance, or to future performance, of such term or condition by the CONTRACTOR, and 
the CONTRACTOR's obligation for performance of that term or condition shall continue in full 
force and effect.

Contract No. 22P172 

Page 45 of 61     

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
15.01  Definitions. 

An “organizational  conflict of interest”  occurs when any of the following circumstances arise: 

a. 

b. 

c. 

Lack of Impartiality or Impaired Objectivity.  When the CONTRACTOR is unable, 
or potentially unable, to provide impartial or objective assistance or advice to the 
COUNCIL due to other activities, relationships,  contracts, or circumstances. 

Unequal Access to Information.  The CONTRACTOR has an unfair competitive 
advantage through obtaining  access to nonpublic information during the 
performance of an earlier contract. 

Biased Ground Rules.  During the conduct of an earlier procurement, the 
CONTRACTOR has established  the ground rules for a future procurement by 
developing specifications, evaluation factors, or similar documents. 

A “personal conflict of interest” exists when: (1) a COUNCIL employee or officer, or an 
employee or officer of any agency interested  in this Contract, and any people closely related to 
such employees or officers has a financial interest  in the CONTRACTOR’s business or this 
Contract; or (2) a person associated with the CONTRACTOR has an interest which would 
conflict in any manner or degree with the CONTRACTOR’s performance of this Contract. 

15.02  Certification.  

The CONTRACTOR certifies that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, and except as 
disclosed in its proposal,  there are no relevant facts or circumstances which could give rise to a 
personal or organizational  conflict of interest in connection with this Contract. The 
CONTRACTOR further certifies that: (1) no one except the CONTRACTOR’s bona fide 
employees or designated  agents or representatives  has been employed or retained to solicit or 
secure this Contract with an agreement or understanding  that a commission, percentage, 
brokerage, or contingent fee would be paid; and (2) the CONTRACTOR and its agents, 
employees, and representatives have not offered or given, and will not offer or give any 
gratuities,  gifts, favors, entertainment, or offers of employment to any official, member, or 
employee of the COUNCIL or other governmental agency to secure this Contract or to secure 
favorable treatment with respect to the awarding or amending, or the making or any 
determination with respect to the performance of this Contract. 

15.03  Conflicts During the Term. If the CONTRACTOR learns of facts or circumstances 
which could give rise to a conflict of interest during the term of this Contract, the CONTRACTOR 
will immediately notify the COUNCIL in writing. The notice must include a full disclosure and the 
CONRACTOR’s proposal for avoiding, mitigating, or neutralizing  the conflict. The COUNCIL 
retains the right to take other appropriate action to eliminate the organizational  conflict of 
interest and the CONTRACTOR shall cooperate as reasonably requested by the Council. If, in 
the Council’s sole discretion, the conflict of interest cannot be adequately avoided, neutralized, 
or mitigated the Council may cancel this Contract. If the Council determines, in its sole 
discretion, that the CONTRACTOR was aware of any conflict of interest described in this 
section prior to award and execution of this Contract, and failed to disclose it, the COUNCIL 
may terminate this Contract for default. 

15.04 Flow Down. The provisions of this clause must be included in all subcontracts for work to 
be performed under this Contract, with the terms "Contract," "CONTRACTOR" and "COUNCIL" 
modified appropriately to preserve the COUNCIL's rights.

mitigation  plan using this template  and any associated documents to the Council. Mitigation  plans will be reviewed by Council 
staff.  The Council  reserves the right  to negotiate  or require additional  mitigation  prior to award  if the Council  deems 
additional  mitigation  steps  necessary.  The Council  is not  required to mitigate  a conflict  If a conflict  of interest  is determined 
to exist  which  cannot  be adequately  mitigated. 

The  Council  requests  mitigation  plans  be returned  as  soon  as  possible  to appropriat ely  mitigate  any  conflict s  prior
