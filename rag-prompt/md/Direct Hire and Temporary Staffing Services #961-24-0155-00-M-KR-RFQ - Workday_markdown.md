ARTICLE 2 - PROJECT OVERVIEW

ARTICLE 2.1 Mission Statement and Objective

The primary mission of ACC’s P2P Department is to acquire the highest quality of goods and services in a timely manner that provided the best value to ACC, and to assure that the
procurement function is conducted for effective college operations and in accordance with applicable Federal and State laws, and ACC policies.

ARTICLE 2.2 Mission Objectives

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ACC’s objectives of this solicitation are to issue one (1) or more contracts to a staffing agency (or agencies) to provide qualified temporary and/or direct hire personnel for ACC's
Information Technology or ACC departments on an as/needed basis during the fiscal year 2024 and beyond, or until the proposed services are no longer needed.

ARTICLE 2.3 Description of Services/Scope of Work (SOW)/Specifications

2.3.1 General

Staffing services requests will be initiated through an ACC department for project-based needs, or to fill a full-time opening through a direct-hire option. The staffing agency will assist in
the sourcing and recruiting process for a full-time opportunity at the College and will be paid a lump-sum recruiting fee for the proposed services. When applicable, ACC will issue
equipment to contract employees. In these cases, firms must accept responsibility for distributing and returning necessary equipment and must accept liability for any damages or theft of
ACC-issued property.

All contract employment must have a specified “employment term” (e.g. six [6] months). Staffing firms must agree to maintain the agreed contract rate for the duration of the
employment term of the initial contract. ACC reserves the right to terminate contract employees at any time for any reason, including within the employment term. Such termination will
end the term of that individual’s employment with ACC and there will be no additional fees paid to the staffing agency for the position after termination. There will be no guarantee and
therefore, should be no expectation that the agency, which provided a terminated employee has a right to backfill the terminated employee's position.

Current and former contract employees may choose to apply for posted jobs with ACC. Upon completion of the employment period, if a contract employee applies for and is selected for
hire to an ACC staff/faculty position, ACC may hire that individual without restriction. Staffing firms must agree that this supersedes any and all non-compete agreements between
associated parties; ACC, selected contract staffing agencies, and contract employees, and therefore agree to release all parties from associated non-compete agreements.

Staffing agencies must agree that in the event that ACC should opt to hire a contract employee prior to the end of the employment term, ACC will pay any and all commissions due to the
staffing agency for the remainder of the contracted period. There will be no additional lump sum payment for contractor conversions.

2.3.2 Staffing Position Requirements

Project/Program Managers,

Technical Engineers,

of payroll time sheets and checks, for all temporary employees provided within this contract.

Provide immediate access to reports measuring absenteeism, turnovers, overtime hours and payroll; or, any customized reports for each employee assigned to ACC. 

Ensure the position staff has the resources and knowledge to understand ACC's business, to ensure accurate evaluation of the staffing requirements and be able to respond
quickly to the needs of the requesting department.

Verify that personnel provided for assignment to ACC positions are fully documented and authorized to work in the United States.  Such documentation shall be provided to
ACC upon request to ensure ACC is not supplied with any unauthorized aliens.

which will be conducted by the department manager or director. The selected respondent(s)/staffing agency(s), must conduct background checks to ensure the best qualified candidates

During the term of the contract, ACC shall monitor SLBE Participation regularly, in accordance with the plan submitted by the selected respondent for a contract, to determine if the SLBE
participation continues to meet or exceed provisions specified in the contract.

Accordingly, if the selected respondent is deemed to have not made a good faith effort to comply with the requirements of the original solicitation, resulting contract and/or the submitted
SLBE Participation Plan, ACC shall report nonperformance relative to its contracts to the comptroller in accordance with its vendor performance tracking system (VPTS) of the Texas
