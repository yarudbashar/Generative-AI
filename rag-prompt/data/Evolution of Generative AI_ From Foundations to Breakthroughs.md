Title: Evolution of Generative AI: From Foundations to Breakthroughs
The roots of Generative AI can be traced back to early attempts at machine learning and neural networks. However, significant breakthroughs occurred with the advent of deep learning and the rise of powerful architectures such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and transformers. Notable milestones include the development of OpenAI's GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) series, which has been a driving force in the evolution of language generation.
