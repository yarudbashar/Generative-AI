Title: Get the most out of your team space




Create a stellar overviewThe overview is the first page visitors will see when they visit your space, so it helps to include some information on what the space is about and what your team is working on.









Add a header image. This gives your overview visual appeal and makes it welcoming for visitors.Explain what the space is for. Start by summarizing the purpose of the space. This could be your team's mission statement or a brief description of the kind of work you do.Share team goals. Add links to your team's OKRs, project plans, and product roadmaps so visitors can quickly get a sense of your team's goals.Tell people how to contact you. Share your timezone and links to Slack channels, email aliases, or other contact details your team uses so visitors can contact you with questions or feedback about your team's work.





Use shortcuts for easy accessShortcuts are helpful for important pages that members of a space might need to get to often. These shortcuts are added and organized by the space administrator. Space admins can link to pages in the space, other related spaces, or relevant external web content as well as reorder the shortcuts as needed.üí≠Start discussions with inline commentsThoughtful responses can get lost and lose context as email replies pile up. And if you neglect to copy someone or want to add them later on, it's difficult for them to get up to speed. Inline comments allow anyone (or everyone) to huddle around an idea while referencing key information on the project page.To leave an inline comment, highlight text on the page and the comment icon will appear.Team members with permission to access the page can respond to any comment. Plus, when a comment thread comes to its natural conclusion, comments can be resolved and cleared away.üëãLoop in team members with @mentions





@mentions on Confluence function like @mentions on social media platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and Slack. Type the @ symbol on a Confluence page or in a comment, begin spelling a team member's first name, and a list will appear. Select the individual to ask a question or assign a task.









üëèEndorse ideas with reactions





Use reactions when you want to support a comment or acknowledge you've seen one without clogging up the thread with another comment.You can also use reactions on a page or blog post. The author of the content will be notified, and if enough team members react or add comments to the content, it'll be surfaced on Confluence home feed
